   Abstract = {This paper presents a new comprehensive growth model which includes numerous historical models as special cases. The new model is derived from a concise biological principle which, unlike earlier theories, relates to growth acceleration . Properties of growth curves, such as asymptotic limits or inflection points, are shown to be incidental in this new context. Possible submodels include not only asymptotic growth (such as von Bertalanffy, Richards, Gompertz, or logistic growth) but also linear, quadratic, or exponential growth. By simple analysis of variance, the observed data can be used directly in deciding which type of model is most appropriate. The new model is cast in terms of parameters which have stable statistical estimates. From this perspective, it is shown how earlier formulations sometimes result in an endless computer search for optimal parameter estimates.},

	DOI={10.1016/j.proenv.2015.07.107}, 
	abstractNote={The habitat preference and spatial distribution of fish populations may depend on a number of environmental factors. For example, the habitat preference for a given species may depend on sea surface height, sea surface temperature and net primary productivity, among others. These variables are however not independent. We investigate an approach for determining a habitat preference index for spatial modelling of a fish population in a non-homogeneous environment. We use copulas to combine univariate habit preference variable distributions into a multivariate habit index. Such an index may be used to estimate a non-homogeneous spatial distribution of a population, with concentrations of fish in ‘favourable’ areas and avoidance of other less ‘favourable’ areas. The efficiency of copulas lies in the ability to study marginal behaviors separately from global dependence.},

	abstractNote={One aim of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is to protect a representative portion of the environment through spatial closures to extractive practices such as fisheries. Although they usually involve the displacement of fisheries, their design rarely takes into account the effect of displacing that fishery on the target fish population. We used a spatially explicit population model of Antarctic toothfish in the Ross Sea region to investigate the effects of the endorsed Ross Sea region MPA on the fishery dynamics and the spatial distribution of the toothfish population. Our study indicates that the MPA will likely improve protection of the juvenile population residing on the Antarctic Shelf, while the number of areas with high levels of depletion is unlikely to increase compared to status quo management. Results also suggested a small increase in the catch limit under the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) harvest management rules, but with a slight reduction in catch rates. We have showed that spatial modelling tools can help inform MPA planning by simultaneously quantifying potential effects on the fish population and the ability to achieve conservation goals.},

	ISSN={01657836}, 
	DOI={10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105381}, 
	abstractNote={Most models used for assessing the status of ﬁsh stocks and providing quantitative advice for ﬁsheries management are not spatially explicit despite the well-known spatial heterogeneity of ﬁsh populations. Statistical spatial distribution modelling, which can derive spatially-resolved biomass from catch rates, is a method increasingly used to infer trends in population biomass, particularly where integrated population models are not available. Although the spatial distribution modelling tool VAST was developed to analyze survey data, such methods have also been used with ﬁsheries-dependent catch and eﬀort data, particularly when survey data are not available. We developed a statistical spatial distribution model for Antarctic toothﬁsh (Dissostichus mawsoni) in the Ross Sea region of the Southern Ocean using the VAST (Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal model) approach. We based the VAST model on catch-rate (catch per unit eﬀort) data from the long-line ﬁshery and compared the biomass time series obtained to that of existing single-area and spatially-explicit integrated population models which have also been developed for this population. The time series obtained from the statistical spatial distribution modelling approach was highly variable between years, inconsistent with constraints imposed on population dynamics by biological parameters, and substantially diﬀerent from biomass trends obtained from the integrated models. Although it has been used successfully in other analyses, in this instance, the spatial distribution modelling could not overcome ﬁne-scale spatial and vessel-based variability in ﬁshery catch rates to estimate the underlying abundance of toothﬁsh at the scale of the Ross Sea region measurable with the more-informed integrated models.},
