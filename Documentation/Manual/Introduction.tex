\section{Introduction\label{sec:Introduction}}

\SPM\ (\SPMName) is a generalised spatially explicit age-structured population dynamics and movement model. \SPM\ can model population dynamics and movement parameters for an age-structured population using a range of observations, including tagging, relative abundance, and age frequency data. \SPM\ implements an age-structured population within an arbitrary shaped spatial structure, which can have user defined categories (e.g., immature, mature, male, female, etc.), and age range. This version of \SPM\ is based on original code by \NIWA\ and subsequently revised and updated (see \ref{sec:version} for more information). 

This manual describes how to use \SPM, including how to run \SPM, how to set up an \config. Further, we describe the population dynamics and estimation methods and describe how to specify and interpret output. 

\subsection{Version\label{sec:version}}

This document describes the \SPMName\ (\SPM\ version \VER{}), available at \href{https://github.com/alistairdunn1/SPM}{https://github.com/alistairdunn1/SPM}. This version of \SPM\ is based on the original \NIWA\ \SPM\ \citep{Dunn_Rasmussen_Mormede_2018}, available at \href{https://github.com/NIWAFisheriesModelling/SPM}{https://github.com/NIWAFisheriesModelling/SPM} dated 20 August 2018, with subsequent revisions and updates by \OceanEnv

The \SPM\ version is suffixed with a date/time (\texttt{yyyy-mm-dd}), giving the revision control system UTC date for the most recent modifications of the documentation, source, and supplementary files included.\index{Version}

\subsection{\I{System requirements}}

\SPM\ is available for most IBM compatible machines running 64-bit \I{Linux} and \I{Microsoft Windows} operating systems.

Several of \SPM s tasks are highly computer intensive and a fast processor is recommended. Depending on the model implemented, some of \SPM s tasks can take a considerable amount of time (minutes to hours) and in extreme cases can even take several days to estimate a model fit. Some of \SPM s tasks can be multi-threaded and hence multi-core machines may perform some tasks quicker than single core processors.

The program itself requires only a few megabytes of hard-disk space but output files can consume large amounts of disk space. Depending on number and type of user output requests, the output could range from a few hundred kilobytes to several hundred megabytes. When estimating model fits, several hundred megabytes of RAM may be required, depending on the spatial size of the model, number of categories, and complexity of processes and observations. For extremely large models, several gigabytes of RAM may be required. 

\subsection{\I{Necessary files}}

For both 64-bit Linux and Microsoft Windows, only the binary file \texttt{spm} or \texttt{spm.exe} is required to run \SPM . No other software is required. We do not compile a version for 32-bit operating systems. 

\SPM\ offers little in the way of  post-processing of the output, and a package available that allows tabulation and graphing of model outputs is recommended. We suggest software such as \href{http://www.microsoft.com}{Microsoft Excel}, \href{http://www.insightful.com}{S-Plus}, or \href{http://www.r-project.org}{\R}\ (R Development Core Team 2007). To assist in the post processing of \SPM\ output, we provide the \texttt{spm} \R\ package for importing the \SPM\ output into \R\ (see Section \ref{sec:post-processing}).

\subsection{Getting help\index{Getting help}\index{User assistance}\index{Notifying errors}}

\SPM\ is distributed as unsupported software, however we would appreciate being notified of any problems or errors in \SPM. See Section \ref{sec:reporting-errors} for how to report errors to the \authors. Further information about \SPM\ can be obtained by contacting the \authors.

\subsection{Technical details\index{Technical specifications}}

\SPM\ was compiled on Linux using \href{http://gcc.gnu.org}{\texttt{gcc}}, the C/C++ compiler developed by the \href{http://gcc.gnu.org}{GNU Project}. The 64-bit Linux \index{Linux} version was compiled using \texttt{gcc} version 4.8.2. Note that \SPM\ is not supported for Linux kernel versions prior to 2.6. The \href{http://www.microsoft.com}{Microsoft Windows}\index{Microsoft Windows} version was compiled using \href{http://www.mingw.org}{Mingw32}\index{Mingw} \href{http://gcc.gnu.org}{\texttt{gcc}} (tdm64-1) 4.9.2. The \href{http://www.microsoft.com}{Microsoft Windows} installer was built using the \href{http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page}{Nullsoft Scriptable Install System}.

\SPM\ uses two minimisers --- the first is closely based on the main algorithm of \cite{779}, and which uses finite difference gradients\index{Finite differences minimiser}, and the second is an implementation of the differential evolution solver\index{Differential evolution minimiser} \citep{1442}, and based on code by \href{mailto:<godwin@pushcorp.com>}{Lester E. Godwin} of \href{http://www.pushcorp.com}{PushCorp, Inc.} 

The random number generator\index{Random number generator} used by \SPM\ uses an implementation of the Mersenne twister random number generator \citep{796}. This, the command line functionality, matrix operations, and a number of other functions use the \href{http://www.boost.org/}{BOOST} C++ library (Version 1.54.0)\index{BOOST C++ library}.

Note that the output from \SPM\ may differ slightly on the different platforms due to different precision arithmetic or other platform dependent implementation issues. The source code\index{\SPM\ source code} for \SPM\ is available either as a part of the installation, or on request from the \authors.

Unit tests of the underlying \SPM\ code are carried out at build time, using the \href{http://www.boost.org/}{BOOST} unit testing framework. The unit test framework aims to cover the key functions and processes within the \SPM\ code base. The unit test code for \SPM\ is available as a part of the underlying source code. You can view a summary of the unit tests and validate the version of \SPM\ you are using has passed these by running

\texttt{spm\_unittests --report\_level=detailed} 

from the command line.
